# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number within 10 attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the player runs out of attempts or guesses correctly, they are presented with the option to restart the game.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: A random number between 1 and 100 is selected by the game each time.
- **User Input**: The user can input their guesses via a text field.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, the game gives feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- **Attempts Tracking**: The game tracks the number of attempts made by the player (up to a maximum of 10 attempts).
- **Restart Option**: Once the game is over (either by winning or losing), a restart button allows the player to play again with a new random number.

## Technologies Used
